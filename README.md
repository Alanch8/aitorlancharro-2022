## Template for the new aitorlancharro.com

The initial idea is to keep a provisional page as the one I have at the moment and to expand it.

For that reason, despite the simplicity of the current page, I have already decided to go for a complete stack with Next.js.

I would like to implement a library like Moment.js or similar to automate the year of the footer.

I want to add a projects section with flex-box or grid to add the projects I make in parallel.

I'm actually working on the design with Figma.
